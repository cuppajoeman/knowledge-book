Note that the triangle equality is intuitively telling us that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line

\section{Limits}

\input{analysis/propositions/limit_of_constant}
Notice that in the above proof that we didn't use our hypothesis in the proof of the consequent, which makes sense because no matter which interval you look in the function is constant there, thus it doesn't depend on the hypothesis at all.

\section{Differentiation}

\input{analysis/theorems/chain_rule}

The chain rule is sometimes written as $ \frac{df }{dx} \left( x \right) = \frac{df}{dg} \left( x \right) \frac{dg}{dx} \left( x \right)  $, but notice that this extends liebniz notation as we only know that $ \frac{df}{dx} = f ^{ \prime  } \left( x \right)   $, and it is not defined for when we take the derivative with respect to another function. This motivates the definition
\[
\frac{df}{dg} \left( x \right) =  \frac{df}{dx} \left( g\left( x \right)  \right)
\]

Notice that the number $ \alpha $ is equal to a limit and that limits are unique, therefore the solution $ \alpha =  f ^{ \prime } \left( \overline{x} \right)  $ is the unique solution to the above proposition. Also since this it the unique solution, we know that there is no other real besides $ f ^{ \prime } \left( \overline{x} \right)  $ where this holds, therefore $ f ^{ \prime } \left( \overline{x} \right)  $ is the best linear approximation to $ f $ at the point $ \overline{x} $. 

Finally notice that if you solve for $ E\left( h \right) $ and then recall that $ E\left( h \right) \in o\left( h \right)  $ we have:
\[
\lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{ \overbracket{\overbracket{f\left( \overline{x} +  h \right)}^{~\text{actual value}~ } -  \overbracket{\left( f\left( \overline{x}  \right)  +  h f ^{ \prime  } \left( \overline{x}  \right) \right)}^{~\text{linear estimation}~  }}^{~\text{error}~  } }{h}= 0
\]

the error is going to zero at a rate which is faster than linear, as if the error were decreasing at a linear rate the limit would evaluate to some non-zero constant.
