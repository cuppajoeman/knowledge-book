\begin{definition}{Wave Quality}{wave_quality}
  Two waves $ w\left(t\right), v\left(t\right)$ are said to have the same quality when there is an $ \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for any $ t \in [0, \infty)$ 
  \[
  w\left(t\right) =  v\left(\alpha t\right)
  \]
  In other words, they only differ by a scaling in the $x$ direction, that is to say, their wave shape is the same.
