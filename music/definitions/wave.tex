\begin{definition}{Wave}{wave}
  A wave is something which moves back and forth over time. We will refer to
  waves as functions over time which output a number between in the range $
  \left[ -1,1 \right]$ where at rest it outputs $ 0$. In other words a wave is a
  periodic function: 
  \[
   w : [0, \infty) \to \left[ -1,1 \right] 
  \]
