\begin{proposition}{Vector Space Unique Additive
Identity}{vector_space_unique_additive_identity}
A vector space has a unique additivity identity
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose \( 0 \) and \( 0 ^{ \prime  }  \) are two identities for
    some vector space \( V \), then 
    \[
    0 ^{ \prime  } =  0 ^{ \prime  } +  0 = 0 +  0 ^{ \prime  } = 0
    \]
    Where first we use the fact that \( 0 \) is an additive identity, then we
    use commutivity and then that \( 0 ^{ \prime  }  \) is an additive identity.
    Thus we've concluded that the two identities are the same, thus there is
    only one identity for a given vector space.
\end{proof}
