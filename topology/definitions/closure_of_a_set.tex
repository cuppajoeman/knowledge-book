\begin{definition}{Closure of a Set}{closure_of_a_set}
Given a subset \( A \) of a topological space, the closure of \( A \) is the
intersection of all closed sets containing \( A \), and is denoted by \(
\overline{A}  \). Note that from \ref{proposition:properties_of_closure} that \(
\overline{A} \) is closed.
\end{definition}
