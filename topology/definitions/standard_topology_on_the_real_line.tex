\begin{definition}
{Standard Topology on the Real Line}{standard_topology_on_the_real_line}
    If \(\mathcal{B} \) is the collection of all open intervals on the real
    line, that is:
    \[
    \left(a, b\right) = \left\{x : a < x < b \right\}
    \]
    then the topology generated by \(\mathcal{B} \) is called the standard
    topology on the real line
