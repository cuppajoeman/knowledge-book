\begin{definition}
{Topology on a Set}{topology_on_a_set}
Let \(X\) be a set. \(A\) collection \(\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)\) of
subsets of \(X\) is called a topology on \(X\) provided that the
following three properties are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}\) and \(X \in \mathcal{T}\).
    \item \(\mathcal{T}\) is closed under finite intersections. That is, given
    any finite collection \(U_{1}, \ldots, U_{n}\) of sets in \(\mathcal{T}\),
    their common intersection \(U_{1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{n}\) is also an
    element of \(\mathcal{T}\).
    \item \(\mathcal{T}\) is closed under arbitrary unions. That is, if
    \(\left\{U_{\alpha}: \alpha \in I\right\}\) is a family of sets in
    \(\mathcal{T}\) (here \(I\) is some indexing set, which may be infinite),
    then their union \(\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_{\alpha}\) is also an element of
    \(\mathcal{T}\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
