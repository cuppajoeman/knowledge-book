\begin{definition}
{Product Topology of two Topological Spaces}{product_topology_of_two_topological_spaces}
Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. The product topology on \(X \times
Y\) is the topology having as basis the collection \(\mathcal{B}\) of all sets
of the form \(U \times V\), where \(U\) is an open subset of \(X\) and \(V\) is
an open subset of \(Y\).
