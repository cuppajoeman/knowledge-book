\begin{definition}
{Basis For a Set}{basis_for_a_set}
Let \(X\) be a set. A collection of sets \(\mathcal{B} \subseteq
\mathcal{P}(X)\) is called a basis on \(X\) if the following two properties
hold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\mathcal{B}\) covers \(X\). That is: \(\forall x \in X, \exists B
    \in \mathcal{B}\) such that \(x \in B \). Or, more concisely, \(X = \bigcup
    \mathcal{B}\).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The reason why \(X = \bigcup \mathcal{B} \) is that \(\bigcup
            _{x \in X} B_{x} \) contains every \(x \in X \) and is a
            subset of \(X \) since each \(B_{x} \) is a subset of \(X \)
            therefore \(\bigcup _{x \in X} B_{x} = X \)
        \end{itemize}
    \item \(\forall B_{1}, B_{2} \in \mathcal{B}, \forall x \in B_{1} \cap
    B_{2}, \exists B \in \mathcal{B}\) such that \(x \in B \subseteq B_{1} \cap
    B_{2}\).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Given a point \(x\) in the intersection of two elements of the
        basis, there is some element of the basis containing \(x\) and contained
        in this intersection.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
We will call the elements of \(\mathcal{B} \) basis elements.
