\begin{definition}
{Lower Limit Topology}{lower_limit_topology}
     The topology generated by \(\mathcal{B} = \left\{\left[ a, b
\right) \subseteq \mathbb{R}: a < b \right\} \) is defined as the lower
     limit topology on \(\mathbb{R} \)
\end{definition}
The corresponding topological space \(\left(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{S}\right)
\) is called the Sorgenfrey line.
