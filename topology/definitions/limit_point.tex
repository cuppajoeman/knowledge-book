\begin{definition}{Limit Point}{limit_point}
If \( A \) is a subset of a topological space \( X \) we say that \( x \) is a
limit point of \( A \) if and only if every neighborhood of \( x \) intersects
\( A \) in some point other than itself. Note that \( x \) need not be an
element of \( A \).
\end{definition}
