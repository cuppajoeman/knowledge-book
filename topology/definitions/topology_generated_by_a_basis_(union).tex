\begin{definition}
{Topology Generated by a Basis
    (Union)}{topology_generated_by_a_basis_(union)}
    Let \(X\) be a set and \(\mathcal{B}\) a basis on \(X\), we define:
    \[
    \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{B}} = \left\{\bigcup \mathcal{C}: \mathcal{C}
    \subseteq \mathcal{B} \right\}
    \]
    and say that \(\mathcal{T} _{B}\) is called the topology generated by \(
    \mathcal{B}\), note that \(\mathcal{C} \)'s elements are subsets of \(
    X \) (basis elements)
\end{definition}
