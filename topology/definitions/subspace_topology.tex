\begin{definition}{Subspace Topology}{subspace_topology}
    Let $X$ be a topological space with topology $\mathcal{T}$. If $Y$ is a subset of $X$, the collection
    \[
    \mathcal{T}_{Y}=\{Y \cap U \mid U \in \mathcal{T}\}
    \]
    is a topology on $Y$, called the subspace topology. With this topology, $Y$ is called a subspace of $X$; its open sets consist of all intersections of open sets of $X$ with $Y$.
\end{definition}
