\begin{definition}
{Subspace Topology}{subspace_topology}
    Let \(X\) be a topological space with topology \(\mathcal{T}\). If \(Y\) is a subset of \(X\), the collection
    \[
    \mathcal{T}_{Y} = \{Y \cap U \mid U \in \mathcal{T}\}
    \]
    is a topology on \(Y\), called the subspace topology. With this topology,
    \(Y\) is called a subspace of \(X\); its open sets consist of all
    intersections of open sets of \(X\) with \(Y\). We will say that \( U \) is
    open in \( Y \) if it belongs to the topology of \( Y \) and open in \( X \)
    if it belongs to the topology of \( X \).
\end{definition}
