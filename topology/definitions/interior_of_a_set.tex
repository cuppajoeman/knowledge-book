\begin{definition}{Interior of a Set}{interior_of_a_set}
Given a subset \( A \) of a topological space \( X \), the interior of \( A \)
is the union of all open sets contained in \( A \), and is written as \(
\operatorname{ int } \left( A \right)  \).Note as a union of open sets, it's
open itself.
\end{definition}
