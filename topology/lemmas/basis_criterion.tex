\begin{lemma}
{Basis Criterion}{basis_criterion}
Let \(X\) be a topological space. Suppose that \(\mathcal{C}\) is a collection
of open sets of \(X\) such that for each open set \(U\) of \(X\) and each \(x\)
in \(U\), there is an element \(C\) of \(\mathcal{C}\) such that \(x \in C
\subset U\). Then \(\mathcal{C}\) is a basis for the topology of \(X\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We'll show it's a basis, so let \(x \in X \) now since \(X \)
        is open we know that there is \(C \in \mathcal{C} \) such that
        \(x \in C \subseteq X \), as needed.
        \item We continue to the second condition, so we take \(C _{1}, C _{
        2} \in \mathcal{C} \) and then let \(x \in C _{1} \cap C _{2}
        \) (we are allowed to do that, because if \(C _{1} \cap C _{2} =
        \varnothing \) then the statement holds vacuously). Since \(\mathcal{C
} \) is a collection of open sets we know that \(C _{1} \cap C _{
        2} \) is also open with respect to \(X \), thus by assumption we have \(C
        _{3} \) such that \(x \in C _{3} \subseteq C _{1} \cap C _{2} \)
        \item The statement also claims that \(\mathcal{T} _{\mathcal{C}
} = \mathcal{T} \)where \(\mathcal{T} \) is the topology of \(X \)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(\subseteq \) Suppose \(W \) is an element of the topology
            generated by \(\mathcal{C} \), then \(W = \bigcup C \) where \(C
            \subseteq \mathcal{C} \), but note that every element of \(C \)
            is an element of \(\mathcal{T} \) since \(\mathcal{C} \)
            is a collection of open subsets of \(X \), therefore \(W \) being
            an arbitrary union is also open with respect to \(X \), that is \(
            W \in \mathcal{T} \).
            \item \(\supseteq \) Suppose \(U \in \mathcal{T} \) then if
            \(x \in U \) we have \(C \in \mathcal{C} \) such that \(x
            \in C \subseteq U\), then by the basis existance definition of a
            generated topology we can see that \(U \in \mathcal{T} _{\mathcal{
            C}} \)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
