{Basis For the Product Topology of Two Topological
Spaces}{basis_for_the_product_topology_of_two_topological_spaces}
Let \(X, Y \) be topological spaces generated by the basis \(\mathcal{B},
\mathcal{C} \) then
\[
\mathcal{D} = \left\{B \times C: B \in \mathcal{B} \enspace \text{and}
\enspace C \in \mathcal{C} \right\}
\]
is a basis for the topology \(X \times Y \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
   We will prove it using the \hyperref[lemma:basis_criterion]{basis
   criterion}. Let \(W \) be an open set of \(X \times Y \), and let \(
   \left(x, y\right) \in W \) since \(\left\{U \times V: U \enspace
   \text{open in} \enspace X \enspace \text{and} \enspace \text{open
   in} \enspace Y \right\} \) is a basis for the topology \(X \times Y \)
   (and a basis covers the set \(X \times Y \)) we have some \(U \times V \)
   such that \(\left(x, y\right) \in U \times V \subseteq W \).
   Additionally, since \(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{C} \) are bases for \(X, Y \) we
   get \(B \) and \(C \) such that \(x \in B \subseteq U \) (since \(U \) is
   open in \(X \) and
   using~\ref{definition:topology_generated_by_a_basis_(basis_existance)}) and
   \(y \in C \subseteq V \) so therefore \(\left(x, y\right) \in B \times C
   \subseteq W \) thus we've found an element of the basis in question which is
   a subset of of the open set, meaning we've satisfied the basis criterion and
   thus \(\mathcal{D} \) is a basis.
\end{proof}
