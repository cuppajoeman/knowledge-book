\begin{proposition}{Subspace Topology
Transitivity}{subspace_topology_transitivity}
Let \( Y \) be a subspace of \( X \). If \( U \) is open in \( Y \) and \( Y \)
is open in \( X \) , then \( U \) is open in \( X \) 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
   If \( U  \) is open in \( Y \) then \( U =  Y \cap  V \)  where \( V \) is
   open in \( X \) since \( Y \)  is also open in \( X \) then their
   intersection is open in \( X \), in other words \( U  \) is open in \( X \) 
\end{proof}
