\begin{proposition}{Hausdorff Yields Unique
Convergence}{hausdorff_yields_unique_convergence}
If \( X \) is a Hausdorff space then a sequence of points \( X \) converges to
at most one point of \( X \) 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose \( x _{ n }  \) is a sequence of points of \( X \) which converges
    to \( x \). Let \( y \in  X \) such that \( y \neq x \), then we have two
    disjoint neighborhoods \( U _{ x } , V _{ y }  \) since \( U _{ x }  \)
    contains all the points of \( x _{ n }  \) except for finitely many, then \(
    V _{ y } \) can only contain finitely many points of \( x _{ n }  \) so that
    \( x _{ n }  \) cannot converge to \( y \) 
\end{proof}
