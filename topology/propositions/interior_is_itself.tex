\begin{proposition}{Interior is Itself}{interior_is_itself}
Suppose that \( A \) is open if and only if  \( \operatorname{ int } \left( A \right) = A  \) 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
If \( A \) is open then \( A \) is an open set set containing \( A \) therefore
as \( \operatorname{int} \left( A \right)  \) is the union of all open sets
containing \( A \), we can see that \( \operatorname{int} \left( A \right) = A
\) since it is a union of sets \( X \subseteq A \) with \( A \) itself. \\
Suppose \( \operatorname{int} \left( A \right) = A \) since \(
\operatorname{int} \left( A \right)  \) is an arbitrary union of open sets then
it is still open, thus \( A \) is open.
\end{proof}
