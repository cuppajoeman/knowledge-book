\begin{proposition}{Every finite point set in a T1 space is
Closed}{every_finite_point_set_in_a_t1_space_is_closed}
Let \( S \) be a finite subset of a topological space \( X \) given then \( T _{
1}  \) property, then \( S \) is closed.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Since finite unions of closed sets are closed
(\ref{proposition:properties_of_closure}), then we can see that we may
equivalently prove that every one point set is closed.\\
Let \( x \in  X \), we will show \( \left\{ x \right\}  \) is closed in \( X \),
so we will show that \( X \setminus \left\{ x \right\}  \) is open via
\ref{proposition:open_iff_every_point_is_in_another_open_set}. Let \( a \in  X
\setminus \left\{ x \right\}  \) then since \( a \neq x \) by the \( T _{ 1 }
\) axiom, we get a neighborhood \( U _{ a }  \) of \( a \) such that \( x
\not\in U _{ a }  \), thus by
\ref{proposition:open_iff_every_point_is_in_another_open_set}, \(  X \setminus
\left\{ x \right\}  \) is open and therefore \( \left\{ x \right\}  \) is
closed.
\end{proof}
