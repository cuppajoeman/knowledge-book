\begin{proposition}{Closure is Itself}{closure_is_itself}
Suppose that \( A \) is closed if and only if \( A = \overline{A}  \) 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Recall that \( \overline{A}  \) is defined as the intersection of all closed
    sets which contain \( A \), thus the smallest set which could contain \( A
    \) is \( A \) itself, since \( A \) was assumed to be closed, the
    intersection is equal to \( A \).\\ 
    Supposing that \( \overline{A} = A \) then since \( \overline{A}  \) is an
    arbitrary intersection of closed sets, then by
    \ref{proposition:properties_of_closure} \( A \) is closed as well.
\end{proof}
