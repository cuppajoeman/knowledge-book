{Topology Generated By a Basis (Basis Existance) is a
Topology}{topology_generated_by_a_basis_(basis_existance)_is_a_topology}
    \begin{center}
        We claim that \(\mathcal{T}_{B}\) is a topology
    \end{center}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vacuously we see that \(\varnothing \in \mathcal{T} _{B}\), and
        \(X \in \mathcal{T} _{B}\) by the first clause of the definition of a
        basis
        \item We will show that \(\bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} U _{i} \in
        \mathcal{T}_{B}\) where \(\forall j \in \left[ n \right], U_{j} \in
        \mathcal{T} _{B}\) by induction
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Base Case
                \[
                \bigcap_{i = 1}^{1} U_{i} = U_{1} \in \mathcal{T}_{B}
                \left(\text{by assumption}\right)
                \]
            \item Inductive Step
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Suppose \(k \in \mathbb{N} ^{+}\) and assume it's true for
                \(k\) we'll show it holds on \(k + 1\)
                    \[
                    \bigcap_{i = 1}^{k + 1} U_{i} = \bigcap_{i = 1}^{k} U_{i}
                    \cap U_{k + 1}
                    \]
                \item Now by induction hypothesis \(\bigcap_{i = 1}^{k} U_{i}
                \in \mathcal{T} _{B}\) and also we know that \(U_{k + 1} \in
                \mathcal{T}_{B}\), therefore by the fact that this topology is
                closed under union for two elements, we know that
                    \[
                    \bigcap_{i = 1}^{k} U_{i} \cap U_{k + 1} \in \mathcal{T}_{B}
                    \]
                    as needed
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item We will show that for some index set \(I\) we have
            \[
                \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{T}_{B}
            \]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item That is
                \[
                    \forall x \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_{\alpha}, \exists B
                    \in \mathcal{B} \text{such that} x \in B \subseteq
                    \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_{\alpha}
                \]
            \item So let \(x \in \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_{\alpha}\), therefore
            we know that \(x \in U_{\beta}\) for some \(\beta \in I\), but since
            \(U _{\beta} \in \mathcal{T}_{B}\) we get \(B_{U} \in \mathcal{B}\)
            such that \(x \in B_{U} \subseteq U_{\beta}\)
            \item Take \(B = B_{U}\) and note that
                \[
                x \in B = B_{U} \subseteq U_{\beta} \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha
                \in I} U _{\alpha}
                \]
                as needed.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
