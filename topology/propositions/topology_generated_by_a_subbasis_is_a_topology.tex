\begin{proposition}
{Topology Generated by a Subbasis is a
Topology}{topology_generated_by_a_subbasis_is_a_topology}
Let \(\mathcal{S} \) be a subbasis, the topology generated by \(\mathcal{
S} \) is a topology
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
To show that this is true we will use first show that that the set of finite
intersections of elements of \(\mathcal{S} \) (let's call this \(\mathcal{
B} _{\mathcal{S}} \enspace \Winkey \)) is a basis, then we know that \(\left\{
\bigcup B : B \subseteq \mathcal{B} _{\mathcal{S}} \right\} \) is a
topology by~\ref{proposition:topology_generated_by_a_basis_(union)_is_a_topology}\\
Let \(x \in X \) then since \(\bigcup \mathcal{S} = X \) we know that \(x
\in S\) for some \(S \in \mathcal{S} \), note that we say that a single
set is a finite intersection, and therefore \(S \in \mathcal{B} _{\mathcal{
S}} \) so we've found a basis element of \(\mathcal{B} _{\mathcal{S}
} \) which contains \(x \). Now for the second condition let \(\mathcal{I},
\mathcal{J} \) be finite index sets, then set \(B _{1} = \bigcap _{ \alpha \in
\mathcal{I}} S _{\alpha} \) and \(B _{2} = \bigcap _{ \alpha \in \mathcal{J}} S
_{\alpha} \), but then their intersection is \( \bigcap _{ \alpha \in \mathcal{
I} \cup \mathcal{ J }    } S _{ \alpha  }  \) and is therefore still a finite
union of elements of \( \mathcal{ S }   \), and so this set satisfies the second
condition for being a basis.
\end{proof}
