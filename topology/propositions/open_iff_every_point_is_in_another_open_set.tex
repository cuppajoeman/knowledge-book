\begin{proposition}{Open iff every point is in another Open
Set}{open_iff_every_point_is_in_another_open_set}
Given a set \( X \) and a topology \( \mathcal{ T } _{ X }   \), \( U \in
\mathcal{ T } _{ X }   \) if and only if 
\[
\forall x \in  U, \exists V \in  \mathcal{ T } _{ X } \enspace \text{such that}
\enspace x \in  V \subseteq U
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
\( \Rightarrow  \) Assuming that \( U \) is open, we let \( x \in  U \) and take
\( V = U \) and surely \( x \in U \subseteq U \), as needed.\\
\( \Leftarrow  \) Suppose the converse, we'd like to show that \( U \) is open,
but note that for each \( x \in  U \) we have \( V _{ x } \in  \mathcal{ T } _{
X}   \) such that \( x \in V _{ x } \subseteq U \), thus \( \bigcup _{ x \in U }
V _{ x } \subseteq U \) but additionally every \( x \in U \) is also in the
union, therefore \( U = \bigcup _{ x \in  U } V _{ x }  \), that is to say that
\( U \) is an arbitrary union of open sets, thus it is open as well by the
definition of a topology.
\end{proof}
