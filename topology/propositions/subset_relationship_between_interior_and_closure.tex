\begin{proposition}{Subset Relationship between Interior and
Closure}{subset_relationship_between_interior_and_closure}
Suppose that \( A \) is a subset of a topological space \( X \), then 
\[
\operatorname{ int } \left( A \right)  \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A} 
\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    By definition \( \operatorname{ int } \left( A \right)  \) is the union of
    sets which are subsets of \( A \) thus it is a subset of \( A \), on the
    otherhand \( \overline{A}  \) is an intersection of sets which all contain
    \( A \) thus \( A \subseteq \overline{A}  \), so we've deduced that \(
    \operatorname{ int } \left( A \right) \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{A}
    \) as needed.
\end{proof}
