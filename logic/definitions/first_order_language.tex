\begin{definition}{First-Order Language}{first_order_language}
    A first order language $\mathcal{L}$ is an infinite collection of distinct
    symbols, no one of which is properly contained in another, sparated into the
    following cateogories:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Parentheses: (,).
		\item Connectives: $\lor, \neg$.
		\item Quantifier: $\forall$.
        \item Variables, one for each positive integer n: $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots,
        v_{n}, \ldots$ The set of variable symbols will be denoted $ \mathcal{ V
        }   $ .
        \item Equality symbol: $=$.
        \item Constant symbols: Some set of zero or more symbols. This set will
        be denoted as $ \mathcal{ C }   $ 
        \item Function symbols: For each positive integer $n$, some set of zero
        or more $n$-ary function symbols as $ \mathcal{ F }  $ .
        \item Relation symbols: For each positive integer $n$, some set of zero
        or more $n$-ary relation symbols as $ \mathcal{ R }  $ .
	\end{enumerate}
	Notice that the requirement that no symbol be properly contained within
	another requires that $ \mathcal{ C } , \mathcal{ F } , \mathcal{ R }     $
	all be disjoint.
\end{definition}
We may denote a language $ \mathcal{ L }   $ as $ \left( \mathcal{ C } ,
\mathcal{ F } , \mathcal{ R }      \right)  $ as these are the only parts of a
the language which may vary (note that we may have different variables, but
their usage and the fact that there are a countably infinite amount of them
makes it so that we don't have to specify them). Also note that we may construct
string, or ordered tuples of elements from a language, so for example we may
write $ ``( v _{ 1 } = \lor"  $, and say that $ ``(" \in ``( v _{ 1 } = \lor"
$, when we want to reference a string we use an equality symbol and a variable
which aren't in the language so we may write $ \gamma :\equiv ( v _{ 1 } = \lor
$ and say that $ ( \in  \gamma $ (notice that we dropped the use of quotations
as it should be clear now that these are strings).
