Let \( \Sigma  \) be a set of sentences, then if every finite subset of \(
\Sigma  \) has a model, then \( \Sigma  \) has a model
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose for the sake of contradiction that every finite subset of \(
    \Sigma  \)  has a model, but \( \Sigma  \) doesn't have a model, by
    \hyperref[propositions:implying_a_contradiction_means_no_model]{the fact
    that \( \Sigma \models \bot  \) if and only if \( \Sigma  \) has no model},
    we can see that \( \Sigma \models \bot  \), by completeness \( \Sigma \vdash
    \bot \) and thus there is a finite deduction \( \mathcal{ D }   \) of \(
    \bot  \), consider \( \Sigma _{ \mathcal{ D }   }  \) the set of all
    elements of \( \Sigma \) which are used in the deduction of \( \bot  \), we
    can see that \( \Sigma _{ \mathcal{ D }   } \vdash \bot \) thus by soundness
    \( \Sigma _{ \mathcal{ D}   } \models \bot  \) which means that \( \Sigma _{
    \mathcal{ D }   }  \) has no model, but \( \Sigma _{ \mathcal{ D }   }  \)
    is a finite subset of \( \Sigma  \) and by assumption must have a model,
    thus we've arrived at a contradiction and so \( \Sigma  \) must have a
    model.
\end{proof}
