\begin{proposition}{Linear Order Implies only one Pair}{linear_order_implies_only_one_pair}
Suppose \( C \) is a linear order then we can never have \( x, y \) and \( y, x
\) in the relation
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose \( x C y \) and \( y C x \) then by transitivity we have that \( x C
    x\) which is a contradiction by non-reflexivity
\end{proof}
