\begin{definition}
{Linear Order}{linear_order}
A relation \(C\) on a set \(A\) is called a linear order if it has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (Comparability) For every \(x\) and \(y\) in \(A\) for which \(x \neq y\), either \(x C y\) or \(y C x\).
    \item (Nonreflexivity) For no \(x\) in \(A\) does the relation \(x C x\) hold.
    \item (Transitivity) If \(x C y\) and \(y C z\), then \(x C z\).
\end{enumerate}
And we say that \( A \) is a linearly ordered set
\end{definition}
