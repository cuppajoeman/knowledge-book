\begin{definition}
{J-Tuple}{j-tuple}
Let \(\mathcal{J}\) be an index set. Given a set \(X\), we define a
\(\mathcal{J}\)-tuple of elements of \(X\) to be a function \(\mathbf{x}:
\mathcal{J} \rightarrow X \). If \(\alpha\) is an element of \(\mathcal{J}\), we
often denote the value of \(\mathbf{x}\) at \(\alpha\) by \(x_{\alpha}\) rather
than \(\mathbf{x}(\alpha)\); we call it the \(\alpha\)-th coordinate of
\(\mathbf{x}\). And we often denote the function \(\mathbf{x}\) itself by the
symbol
\[
\left(x_{\alpha}\right)_{\alpha \in \mathcal{J}}
\]
which is as close as we can come to a "tuple notation" for an arbitrary index
set \(\mathcal{J}\). We denote the set of all \(\mathcal{J}\)-tuples of elements
of \(X\) by \(X^{\mathcal{J}}\).
\end{definition}
