\begin{proposition}{Product is Zero, then at least one of them is
Zero}{product_is_zero,_then_at_least_one_of_them_is_zero}
Let \(  x, y \in  \mathbb{F} \) then 
\[
x \cdot y =  0
\] 
if and only if at least one of \( x, y \) are \( 0 \) 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    \( \Rightarrow \) Suppose that \( x y = 0 \) and for the sake of
    contradiction that neither of \( x,y \) are zero, then both of them have
    inverses, namely \( y ^{-1}  \) exists, so that
    \[
    x y = 0 \Leftrightarrow xy y ^{-1} = 0 y ^{-1} \Leftrightarrow x = 0
    \]
    which is a contradiction since \( x \neq 0 \).\\
    \( \Leftarrow  \) Suppose that at least one of \( x, y \) are \( 0 \)
    without loss of generality let's assume that \( x = 0 \), then 
    \[
    x y =  0 y = 0
    \]
    where we used \ref{proposition:0_times_any_constant_is_0}
\end{proof}
